# Israel-Palestine Conflict: A Visual Data Story
Welcome to my interactive dashboard,where I shed light on the Israel-Palestine conflict from 2000 to 2023. 

# What’s Inside
Who’s Affected? We explore demographic data—citizenship, gender, age, and involvement in hostilities—to bring a human perspective to the numbers. It’s not just about the events; it’s about the people affected.
Regional Hotspots: By mapping key regions like Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem, you’ll see where incidents concentrate and how patterns shift over time.
Trends Over Time: Year-over-year trends provide a big-picture view of the conflict, allowing you to spot patterns, seasonality, and any notable spikes in incidents.
The Nature of Incidents: From injury types to the place of residence, this section dives deeper into what happened and where, adding another layer to the overall picture.
